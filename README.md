# Lorentzian-Fit-kit

## Description:

This repository contains code for fitting Lorentzian curves with different types of baseline function. 
The Lorentzian curve is a common model used in numerous scientific domains to characterize spectral lines, resonances, and other phenomena exhibiting a distinctive peak shape. The inclusion of various baseline functions enables users to account for and model the underlying background signal inherent in experimental data, which may vary due to factors such as noise, drift, or systematic effects.

 Currently supported baseline types include:

Linear
Quadratic
Cubic

## Input Data Format:

The input data should be provided in a CSV format. It should contain two columns: one for the independent variable (e.g., wavelength, frequency) and another for the corresponding dependent variable (e.g., intensity, amplitude).
